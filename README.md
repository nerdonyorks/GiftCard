# GiftCard  

A simple festive “gift card / greeting card” web page — a playful interactive way to send holiday wishes.  

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This is a lightweight web page that displays a cheerful greeting card. Visitors are invited to “Tap to Open,” and upon interaction the card reveals a message — e.g. “Yes ✓ No ✗ … Yay or Nay?” — and festive emoji icons. It’s a fun, minimal HTML/CSS/JS (or even plain HTML) project intended to share holiday greetings in a creative way.  

## 📦 What’s Inside / Technologies Used  
- HTML (static)  
- CSS (for styling — festive colors/emojis)  
- (Optional) minimal JavaScript if interaction is added  
- No build tools or dependencies — just plain web technologies  

## 🚀 How to Use / View the Project  
Because this is a static webpage, you can open it directly in a browser.  

1. Clone or download the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nerdonyorks/GiftCard.git
